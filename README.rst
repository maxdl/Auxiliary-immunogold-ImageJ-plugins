===================================
Auxiliary immunogold ImageJ plugins
===================================

These are auxiliary ImageJ plugins, to be used with the family of analysis tools I have written for analysis of immunogold labeled electron micrographs. 

- DistToRandomLine_.java is used to quantify immunogold labeling in relation to randomly placed line regions of interest. It is used in conjunction with 
DistToPath.py.
- ParticleDensityRandomBox_.java is used to quantify immunogold labeling in relation to randomly placed rectangular regions of interest. It is used in
conjunction with PointDensity.py.

for more information.
